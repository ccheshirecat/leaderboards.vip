**Review of Claude's Sprint 2 Output:**

Overall, the code provided by Claude is excellent and follows the specifications closely. It has successfully implemented:

*   **API Endpoint (GraphQL):** The `LeaderboardResolver` correctly defines the `leaderboardData` and `leaderboardConfig` queries, including pagination arguments. It also uses the `AuthGuard` for protection.
*   **Leaderboard Service:** The `LeaderboardService` includes `getLeaderboardData` and `getLeaderboardConfig` methods. It correctly implements caching using `@nestjs/cache-manager` and retrieves data from the `Leaderboard` table. The pagination logic is also correct.
*   **Frontend Component (Conceptual):** Although I don't have the actual frontend code, Claude has correctly described the `LeaderboardTable` component's responsibilities (fetching data, displaying it, handling loading/errors, pagination).
*   **Authentication (Conceptual - SuperTokens on Cloudflare Workers):** Claude correctly refactored the `SuperTokensService` to interact with a *self-hosted* SuperTokens Core on Cloudflare Workers (using HTTP requests). It also provides an `AuthGuard`.
*   **Tenant Middleware:** The `tenantMiddleware` correctly extracts the `tenantId` from the `X-Tenant-Id` header, fetches tenant data (with caching), and attaches it to the request.
*   **API Integration:** The GraphQL resolvers and the frontend Apollo Client are set up to use the `tenantId`.

**Key Observations and Potential Improvements:**

*   **SuperTokens Deployment:** A critical next step is deploying the SuperTokens Core to Cloudflare Workers. This is a *prerequisite* for fully testing the authentication flow. The code assumes this deployment exists.
*   **Frontend Authentication UI:** The frontend authentication UI (login/signup forms, etc.) is not yet implemented. This is a major part of making authentication usable.
*   **Redis Connection:** Although caching is implemented in both `LeaderboardService` and `TenantMiddleware`, we haven't actually set up the Redis connection yet in the main application. The previous message includes an attempt to get the configuration right, but it needs to be verified.
*   **Error Handling:** While there's some basic error handling, it could be made more robust (e.g., specific error codes, more detailed error messages).
*   **Type Safety:** There's some use of `any` for type casting (e.g., in `SuperTokensService` and `tenantMiddleware`). We should aim for stricter typing.
* **Leaderboard Response Model:** The `LeaderboardResponse` model was only declared, but not implemented in the resolvers.
* **Missing imports:** Some models/ return types may be missing from the imports
* **Referral Code:** A referral code was added to the user model without it being defined as a field

**Next Steps (Immediate):**

1.  **Deploy SuperTokens Core to Cloudflare Workers:** This is the *highest priority*. Follow the SuperTokens documentation for this. You'll need to configure SuperTokens (email/password recipe, etc.) after deployment. You'll obtain a `connectionURI` and an `apiKey` for your SuperTokens instance.
2.  **Update Environment Variables:**
    *   **Backend (`packages/backend/.env`):** Add `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` and `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY` (using the values from your Cloudflare Workers deployment). Also add `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT`.
    *   **Frontend (`packages/frontend/.env.local`):** You'll eventually need to provide the SuperTokens Core URL to the frontend.
3.  **Test End-to-End:** Once SuperTokens is deployed and the environment variables are set, try to:
    *   Fetch leaderboard data from the frontend (using a hardcoded `tenantId` and `casino`). Verify that the `X-Tenant-Id` header is being sent.
    *   Test the caching (make multiple requests and check the logs to see if the cache is being hit).
4.  **Implement Redis Connection** Update the app module to include the redis configuration.

**Planning Sprint 3:**

Given the above, Sprint 3 should focus on:

**Sprint 3 Goal:** Implement frontend authentication, complete the SuperTokens integration, and connect the frontend to the backend for authenticated data fetching.

**Tasks:**

1.  **SuperTokens Core Deployment to Cloudflare Workers [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Deploy the SuperTokens Core to Cloudflare Workers, following the official SuperTokens documentation.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** SuperTokens Core is running on Cloudflare Workers and accessible via a URL.
    *   **Specifications:** Follow the SuperTokens guide for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

2.  **Configure SuperTokens (Post-Deployment) [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Configure the SuperTokens Core instance (after deployment). This includes setting up the email/password recipe, configuring email delivery, and obtaining the API key.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** SuperTokens is configured for email/password authentication. You have the `connectionURI` and `apiKey`.
    *   **Specifications:** Refer to the SuperTokens documentation for configuring recipes.

3.  **Update Backend Environment Variables [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Update the `.env` file in the `packages/backend` directory with the `SUPERTOKENS_CONNECTION_URI` and `SUPERTOKENS_API_KEY` values from your Cloudflare Workers deployment, as well as redis connection URL.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The environment variables are set correctly.
    *   **Specifications:** These values should come from your SuperTokens Core deployment on Cloudflare Workers.

4.  **Implement Frontend Authentication UI [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Create the necessary UI components in the `packages/frontend` directory for:
        *   Signup
        *   Login
        *   Logout
        *   User Profile (basic)
        * Potentially, "Forgot Password" and "Reset Password" flows
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The UI components exist and are visually functional (basic styling is sufficient for now).
    *   **Specifications:** Use SuperTokens' pre-built UI components (if possible) or create custom components. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

5.  **Integrate SuperTokens Frontend SDK [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Initialize the SuperTokens frontend SDK (e.g., `supertokens-auth-react`) in your Next.js application. Configure it to point to your Cloudflare Workers-hosted SuperTokens Core URL.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** The SuperTokens SDK is initialized correctly.
    *   **Specifications:** Follow the SuperTokens documentation for integrating with your chosen frontend framework (React/Next.js). Use the `connectionURI` and `apiKey` from your SuperTokens Core deployment.

6.  **Connect Frontend Authentication to Backend [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Implement the authentication logic in your frontend components (using the SuperTokens SDK). This includes:
        *   Handling user signup and login.
        *   Storing the JWT in local storage (or a cookie).
        *   Automatically adding the JWT to the `Authorization` header for API requests (you've already set this up in your Apollo Client, so it should work automatically).
        *   Handling logout.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can successfully sign up, log in, and log out. The frontend correctly handles the JWT.
    *   **Specifications:** Use the SuperTokens SDK methods for handling authentication.

7.  **Test Authenticated API Requests [ ]**

    *   **Task:** Test the end-to-end flow:
        *   Log in on the frontend.
        *   Fetch leaderboard data (which is now protected by the `AuthGuard`).
        *   Verify that the data is fetched successfully.
        *   Log out.
        *   Try to fetch leaderboard data again. Verify that you receive an unauthorized error.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Authenticated requests succeed, and unauthenticated requests fail.

8.  **Refactor for Type Safety [ ]**
     *   **Task:** Replace instances of `any` with more descriptive types.
     *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Instances of `any` are reduced.

9. **Fix Referral Code Generation [ ]**
    * **Task**: Add referral code generation to the user service when creating players and subaffiliates.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**: All users have a unique referral code.

10. **Implement Redis connection [ ]**
    * **Task**: Implement Redis Connection in the backend.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**: Able to successfully connect to redis and retrieve/set data.

This sprint focuses on getting the authentication flow working end-to-end, making your platform usable and secure. It builds directly on the work done in Sprint 2 and sets the stage for adding more complex features in later sprints.
